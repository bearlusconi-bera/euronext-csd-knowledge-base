Article 69 – Matching of Settlement Instructions

1. The matching is carried out to check that the information corresponds to the
   settlement instructions entered.
2. The T2S system supplies the participants with complete disclosure regarding
   the  status  of  the  settlement  instructions  entered and  the  settlement
   instructions entered by the counterparty awaiting matching (alledgement).
3. The matching checks referred to in paragraph 1 cover mandatory matching
    fields, but may also regard the non-mandatory matching fields.
4. Unmatched settlement instructions may be changed by the Participants, but
   only as regards status indicators.

Article 70 - Cancellation of the settlement Instructions

1. Settlement Instructions may be unilaterally cancelled by the Participant which
   entered them up to the time of the matching, on condition that such Settlement
   Instructions were not entered as non-changeable.
2. Matched settlement Instructions may be cancelled bilaterally, with the consent
   of both Participants, or upon request of an entity acting on their behalf, subject
   to the prior submission to Monte Titoli of the relevant mandate.
3. Cancellations are sent by the Participants with the methods and the time
   frames provided for in the Instructions. They then go through the acquisition
   phase and,  if referring to matched settlement Instructions, the matching
   phase. When  the  cancellations  are  matched,  the  original  settlement
   Instructions are cancelled.
4. Market Management Companies and central counterparties may ask Monte
    Titoli to block these functionalities with regard to their settlement Instructions,
   according to the methods and conditions provided for in the operating rules for
   these systems and in accordance with the provisions for T2S.
5. Cancellations may also be entered by Monte  Titoli at the request of the
   Participants and in the other cases established by the Rules, in accordance with
   the provisions above.
6. CoSD Settlement Instructions may only be cancelled by Monte Titoli.
7. Automatic cancellation of settlement instructions from the T2S platform is
   disposed when instructions:
   a) have not passed the daily validation phase;
   b) are not matched or are not settled within the time limits provided in the

 3    1.6.1.2.2 Overview

 4   T2S provides T2S Actors matching services for Settlement Instructions that require to be matched in T2S
 5     (i.e. all Settlement Instructions except the Settlement Instructions with Match status “Matched” regardless
 6    their ISO indicator, ISO transaction code (e.g. CORP) or hold status(es)).

 7    Settlement Restrictions, Maintenance instructions, Realignment instructions, Auto-collaterisation instructions,
 8   Reimbursement auto-collaterisation instructions and Liquidity transfers do not go through the T2S matching
 9    process. The matching of Cancellation Instructions does not follow the rules presented in this section and is
10    presented in section Instruction Cancellation [ 280]).

11   T2S allows CSDs and CSD participants to send already matched instructions Cross-CSD and Intra CSD. In-
12    structions that enter into T2S as already matched are created with the matching fields as if they were
13   matched in T2S (i.e. follow the same matching rules as in T2S).

                                                                                                 Application Processes Description

 1    1.6.1.2.3 Matching process

 2   When a new instruction enters T2S, the matching process compares 194 each of the Mandatory and Non-
 3   mandatory matching fields of the Settlement Instruction with the Settlement Instructions that remain un-
 4   matched in T2S:

 5         l  Mandatory matching fields are those fields that must be present in the instruction and which values
 6       should be the same in both Settlement Instructions except Settlement Amount for DVP/PFOD for which a
 7        tolerance might be applied and for Credit/Debit Code (CRDT/DBIT) and Securities Movement Type Deliv-
 8        er/Receiver (DELI/RECE), whose values match opposite.

 9         l  Non-mandatory matching fields can be Additional or Optional:

10      – Additional matching fields are initially not mandatory but their values have to match when one of the
11          counterparties provides a value for them in its instruction. Consequently, once an Additional matching
12             field is filled in by one Counterparty, the other Counterparty should also fill it in, since a filled-in Addi-
13            tional matching field cannot match with a field with no value.

14      – In case of Optional matching fields, a filled-in field may match with a field with no value (unlike Addi-
15            tional matching fields), but when both Parties provide a value, the values have to match.

16   Depending on the Transaction Type T2S considers some fields mandatory or not, as described in the table
17    below. The following tables and illustrations provide examples of the use of the mandatory, optional and
18    additional fields in the matching process.

        194   Upper and lower case letters are considered as different when comparing the values of two different instructions. In case a given matching field is
                      filled in two different instructions with the same reference but a different combination of upper and lower case letters, this matching field is not
                 subject to matching.

 7     If all the Matching fields on both instructions match, except for the Settlement Amount, T2S checks if the
 8    difference between both Settlement Amounts is compliant with the tolerance amount configured in T2S.

 9    This tolerance amount set up in T2S has two different bands per currency, depending on the cash counter-
10    value. ECSDA proposal for Euro is the following:

 3    In case there is more than one potentially matching Settlement Instruction, T2S chooses the one having the
 4    smallest Settlement Amount difference. If there is more than one potentially matching Settlement Instruc-
 5    tion with the same Settlement Amount, T2S chooses the one with the closest entry time in T2S. When Set-
 6    tlement Instructions with different Settlement Amount are matched, the amount that T2S submits for set-
 7    tlement as Matched Settlement Amount is the Settlement Amount indicated by the Deliverer of the securi-
 8     ties.

 9    After successful matching of both instructions, the T2S Actors receive a Status Advice message as described
10     in section Send Settlement Instruction. This Status Advice will also contain the T2S Matching Reference as-
11    signed to both Settlement Instructions that have been matched by T2S and the T2S Reference and Account
12   Owner Reference of the counterparty´s instruction. Interested parties can also be informed depending on
13    their message subscription preferences (see Section Status Management [ 653] and section Message sub-
14    scription [ 135]).

15    In case the Settlement Instruction does not match after the first attempt, T2S sends a Settlement Al-
16    legement message (after having waited a certain period of time) to the Counterparty informing that there is
17   a Settlement Instruction alleged against it. The Allegement process is described below (See section Al-
18    legement [ 271]), the dialogue is reflected in section Send Settlement Instruction.

19   T2S automatically cancels Settlement Instructions that remain unmatched after a certain period of time (See
20    section Instruction Cancellation [ 280] and section Instructions Recycling [ 296]).

1.6.1.8 Posting


 2    1.6.1.8.1 Concept

 3   The posting application process checks if the settlement of Settlement Instructions, Settlement Restrictions
 4   and Liquidity Transfers can be achieved considering their eligibility to settlement and the available resources.

 5    In case of high concentration of Settlement Instructions on the same resource (i.e. debiting the same DCA,
 6    debiting or crediting the same SAC not allowed to be negative), the Settlement Instructions could be
 7   grouped without any business links between one another.

 8     It may resort to the optimising application process if needed for the settlement (See section Optimising
 9    [ 335]).

10   When the check is satisfactory, the posting application process updates the cash balance, securities position
11   and limit headroom, resulting in the irrevocability of the settlement.

Update to settlement messages
for Repo Transaction.
   To the attention of:                           Settlement Agent


   Priority:                                      Medium


   Topic:                                         Update to settlement messages for Repo
                                                   Transaction.
Dear Client,

Following the communications sent by Euronext Clearing with the subject “Update to settlement message
population for Repo transactions”, Euronext Securities Milan acknowledges that, starting from 20 July 2026,
Euronext Clearing will populate the common reference field (:20C::COMM//, <CmonId>) in settlement
instructions sent to T2S as follows:

     ➢    for settlement instructions related to the start leg of Same Day Repo transactions (i.e. for
          settlement instructions for which there is no netting), the field will be populated with the TUI code
          of the repo contract;

     ➢    for settlement instructions resulting from the netting of positions, the field will continue to be
          populated with the Settlement Reference, maintaining the current system behaviour.


As a result, these changes will be reflected in the settlement information provided by Euronext Securities
Milan.
