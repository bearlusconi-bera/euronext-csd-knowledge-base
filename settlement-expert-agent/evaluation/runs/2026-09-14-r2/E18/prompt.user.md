EXCERPT (§1.4.4.4; PDF 193–194):
1.4.4.4 Real-time settlement (RTS)

 4    This section presents the real-time settlement processes in the T2S settlement day. The real-time settlement
 5    period starts after the end of the night-time settlement and is followed by the end of day period.

 6    In case the NTS completes before 3.00 from Mondays to Fridays and before 2.30 on Saturdays, real-time
 7    settlement period begins before the start of the maintenance window.

 8   The real-time settlement period includes:

 9         l  The real-time settlement preparation;

10         l  The real-time settlement with the five partial settlement windows to optimise maximum value and vol-
11      umes of settlement transactions, which are unsettled because of lack of securities:

12      – The first partial settlement window between 08:00 and 08:30;

13      – The second partial settlement window between 10:00 and 10:15;

14      – The third partial settlement window between 12:00 and 12:15;

15      – The fourth partial settlement window between 14:00 and 14:15;

16      – The fifth partial settlement window is 30 minutes before the beginning of the DVP cut-off time, then
17         between 15:30 and 16:05 or the closure of both DVP cut-offs (whichever comes first).

18   The previously unsettled Settlement Instructions and Settlement Restrictions from night-time settlement are
19    attempted for settlement in the real-time settlement period with the arrival of new resources (securities for
20    delivery, securities in positions earmarked available for collateral, cash). 143 Additionally T2S performs a set-
21    tlement attempt for any new intraday Settlement Instructions, Settlement Restrictions and liquidity transfers
22    validated and accepted during real-time settlement period;

23         l  The real-time settlement closure with different cut-offs and events for different Settlement Instructions,
24       Settlement Restrictions and liquidity transfers categories.

        143   During the regular recycling, the mechanism ensures that a transaction will not be recycled if the transaction sent just before has not been at-
               tempted for settlement. This serialization process will concern all transactions with age >= 3 selected by the Regular Recycling process following a
                   credit in securities or cash or an increase in CMB headroom or limit, guaranteeing that an older transaction will be attempted before a younger one
                with the same priority. The transactions selected by one given recycling process will be segregated into eight groups, depending on their priority
              and age:

               Group 1         Group 2         Group 3         Group 4         Group 5         Group 6         Group 7         Group 8
                    Priority 1           Priority 1           Priority 2           Priority 2           Priority 3           Priority 3           Priority 4           Priority 4
              Age >= 3       Age < 3        Age >= 3       Age < 3        Age >= 3       Age < 3        Age >= 3       Age < 3
               Should the serialization process be too long (over a predetermined adjustable maximum duration), it will be automatically stopped to come back to
                the regular recycling process.

 1         l Some of these cut-offs and events may be currency dependent.

 2    For the ease of presentation, the real-time settlement period is shown in two parts:

 3         l  The real-time settlement;

 4         l  The real-time settlement closure.

 5   The real-time settlement period also includes processes specific to the penalty mechanism. These are com-
 6    prised of the processing of information received within T2S including securities subject to penalties infor-
 7    mation, penalty modification requests and daily and historic prices for penalties. This information is subse-
 8    quently used for penalty calculations and reporting.
