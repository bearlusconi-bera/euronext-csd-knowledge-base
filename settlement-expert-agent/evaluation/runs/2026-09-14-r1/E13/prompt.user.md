10    1.6.1.2.1 Concept

11   T2S Matching process compares the settlement details of Settlement Instructions provided by the deliverer
12   and the receiver of securities to ensure that both parties agree on the settlement terms of the transaction in
13   a standardised way, according to the T2S rules, which are compliant with the European Central Securities
14    Depositories Association (ECSDA) and the European Securities Forum (ESF) matching proposals.

 3    1.6.1.2.2 Overview

 4   T2S provides T2S Actors matching services for Settlement Instructions that require to be matched in T2S
 5     (i.e. all Settlement Instructions except the Settlement Instructions with Match status “Matched” regardless
 6    their ISO indicator, ISO transaction code (e.g. CORP) or hold status(es)).

 7    Settlement Restrictions, Maintenance instructions, Realignment instructions, Auto-collaterisation instructions,
 8   Reimbursement auto-collaterisation instructions and Liquidity transfers do not go through the T2S matching
 9    process. The matching of Cancellation Instructions does not follow the rules presented in this section and is
10    presented in section Instruction Cancellation [ 280]).

11   T2S allows CSDs and CSD participants to send already matched instructions Cross-CSD and Intra CSD. In-
12    structions that enter into T2S as already matched are created with the matching fields as if they were
13   matched in T2S (i.e. follow the same matching rules as in T2S).

                                                                                                 Application Processes Description

 1    1.6.1.2.3 Matching process

 2   When a new instruction enters T2S, the matching process compares 194 each of the Mandatory and Non-
 3   mandatory matching fields of the Settlement Instruction with the Settlement Instructions that remain un-
 4   matched in T2S:

 5         l  Mandatory matching fields are those fields that must be present in the instruction and which values
 6       should be the same in both Settlement Instructions except Settlement Amount for DVP/PFOD for which a
 7        tolerance might be applied and for Credit/Debit Code (CRDT/DBIT) and Securities Movement Type Deliv-
 8        er/Receiver (DELI/RECE), whose values match opposite.

 9         l  Non-mandatory matching fields can be Additional or Optional:

10      – Additional matching fields are initially not mandatory but their values have to match when one of the
11          counterparties provides a value for them in its instruction. Consequently, once an Additional matching
12             field is filled in by one Counterparty, the other Counterparty should also fill it in, since a filled-in Addi-
13            tional matching field cannot match with a field with no value.

14      – In case of Optional matching fields, a filled-in field may match with a field with no value (unlike Addi-
15            tional matching fields), but when both Parties provide a value, the values have to match.

16   Depending on the Transaction Type T2S considers some fields mandatory or not, as described in the table
17    below. The following tables and illustrations provide examples of the use of the mandatory, optional and
18    additional fields in the matching process.

        194   Upper and lower case letters are considered as different when comparing the values of two different instructions. In case a given matching field is
                      filled in two different instructions with the same reference but a different combination of upper and lower case letters, this matching field is not
                 subject to matching.

 7     If all the Matching fields on both instructions match, except for the Settlement Amount, T2S checks if the
 8    difference between both Settlement Amounts is compliant with the tolerance amount configured in T2S.

 9    This tolerance amount set up in T2S has two different bands per currency, depending on the cash counter-
10    value. ECSDA proposal for Euro is the following:

                   > EUR 100.000                                    EUR 25

 3    In case there is more than one potentially matching Settlement Instruction, T2S chooses the one having the
 4    smallest Settlement Amount difference. If there is more than one potentially matching Settlement Instruc-
 5    tion with the same Settlement Amount, T2S chooses the one with the closest entry time in T2S. When Set-
 6    tlement Instructions with different Settlement Amount are matched, the amount that T2S submits for set-
 7    tlement as Matched Settlement Amount is the Settlement Amount indicated by the Deliverer of the securi-
 8     ties.

 9    After successful matching of both instructions, the T2S Actors receive a Status Advice message as described
10     in section Send Settlement Instruction. This Status Advice will also contain the T2S Matching Reference as-
11    signed to both Settlement Instructions that have been matched by T2S and the T2S Reference and Account
12   Owner Reference of the counterparty´s instruction. Interested parties can also be informed depending on
13    their message subscription preferences (see Section Status Management [ 653] and section Message sub-
14    scription [ 135]).

15    In case the Settlement Instruction does not match after the first attempt, T2S sends a Settlement Al-
16    legement message (after having waited a certain period of time) to the Counterparty informing that there is
17   a Settlement Instruction alleged against it. The Allegement process is described below (See section Al-
18    legement [ 271]), the dialogue is reflected in section Send Settlement Instruction.

19   T2S automatically cancels Settlement Instructions that remain unmatched after a certain period of time (See
20    section Instruction Cancellation [ 280] and section Instructions Recycling [ 296]).

1.6.1.8 Posting


 2    1.6.1.8.1 Concept

 3   The posting application process checks if the settlement of Settlement Instructions, Settlement Restrictions
 4   and Liquidity Transfers can be achieved considering their eligibility to settlement and the available resources.

 5    In case of high concentration of Settlement Instructions on the same resource (i.e. debiting the same DCA,
 6    debiting or crediting the same SAC not allowed to be negative), the Settlement Instructions could be
 7   grouped without any business links between one another.

 8     It may resort to the optimising application process if needed for the settlement (See section Optimising
 9    [ 335]).

10   When the check is satisfactory, the posting application process updates the cash balance, securities position
11   and limit headroom, resulting in the irrevocability of the settlement.

1.6.1.10 Realignment


 2    1.6.1.10.1 Concept

 3   The realignment application process handles the cases of:

 4         l  Cross-CSD settlements, i.e. settlements between T2S Actors of different CSDs, the latter being in T2S;

 5         l  External-CSD settlements, i.e. settlements between T2S Actors of different CSDs, with some of the CSDs
 6        involved in the settlement being external to T2S.

 7    Cross-CSD settlement is achieved in T2S with the simultaneous booking of cash and securities for Settlement
 8    Instructions between participants of different CSDs. Once incoming Settlement Instructions are matched (or
 9    validated for already matched incoming Settlement Instructions), the realignment application process creates
10    automatically all the requested Settlement Instructions between the involved CSDs, referred hereafter as
11   T2S generated realignment Settlement Instructions. This automatic generation relies on links set in the ref-

13   Upon the matching of Settlement Instructions, or upon the validation of already matched Settlement Instruc-
14    tions, the realignment application process verifies if the incoming business Settlement Instructions are re-
15    quiring realignment Settlement Instructions on securities accounts other than those of the submitting T2S
16    Actors (e.g. on the accounts of the issuer CSD).

 1   When the need to realign is identified, the realignment application process creates automatically the T2S
 2    generated realignment Settlement Instructions, based on the cross-CSD links set by CSDs in the reference
 3    data.

 4   The T2S generated realignment Settlement Instructions are then validated, and linked to the initial underly-
 5    ing Settlement Instructions through two links INFO providing the references of both business Settlement
 6    Instructions for information purposes. T2S ensures that the T2S generated realignment Settlement Instruc-
 7    tions and their business Settlement Instructions settle on an all-or-none basis.

 9   Parametersnecessaryforrealignment

10    Role and links between CSDs for cross-CSD and external-CSD settlement

11    Irrespective of whether it is a cross-CSD or an external-CSD settlement, a CSD is defined for the realignment
12    process as:

13         l  The issuer CSD, when it is the CSD in which the security has been issued and distributed on behalf of
14       the Issuer;

15         l  The investor CSD, when it is the CSD of at least one party of the Settlement Instruction;

16         l  Or both, when it is the CSD in which the security has been issued and the CSD of at least one party of
17       the Settlement Instruction.

18   To manage the cross-CSD and external-CSD settlements, each investor CSD has the choice between:

19         l  Opening an omnibus account (see section below) in the books of the issuer CSD to reflect the holdings
20        of its participants for the securities, or;

21         l  Opening an omnibus account in the books of any other CSD being already an investor CSD for the same
22         financial instrument.

23    In both cases, the CSD where the omnibus account is opened is defined as the technical issuer of the inves-
24    tor CSD for the given securities. For a given ISIN, an investor CSD can define several such investor-type CSD
25     links, meaning that it can define several technical issuer CSDs for a given ISIN. However, one of those links
26    (and only one) should be given the preference for settlement under simple configurations (all CSDs in T2S,
27   no multi-issuance), this is the “default” link. Under more complex configurations (external CSD configuration,
28    multi-issuance), the preference should go first to one of the other “alternative” links, more specifically the
29   one pointing to the counterpart CSD, in case it is set up in the reference data. If T2S cannot find an alterna-
30     tive link to the counterparty CSD or if such an alternative link is found, but unusable due to a missing static
31    data (i.e. invalid or incomplete configuration of CSD Account Links), T2S reverts back to the valid default
32     links should be used also under those complex configurations.

33    Only one link, whether default or alternative, can be set up towards a given technical issuer CSD for a given
34    investor CSD and a given ISIN at the same point in time.

35   The issuer-type CSD link cannot be an alternative link, it has always to be defined as a “default” link. Only
36    investor-type links can be flagged “alternative”. Those links cannot be defined for an investor CSD outside
37   T2S and they cannot point to a technical issuer CSD outside T2S.

 1   To that purpose, CSDs are required to configure the following set-up in the reference data:
 2

               PARAMETERS                                      DEFINITION

        Security CSD links                   Each investor CSD has to define at least one technical issuer CSD per securities
                                                                            it intends to set as eligible for settlement (See section Securities reference data
                                              [ 71]). This results in the creation of one or several links between the investor
                                   CSD and its technical issuer CSD(s) for a given financial instrument.

                                  Among those links, one (and only one) should be flagged “default”, the other
                                         ones being considered “alternative”.

                                      The alternative links can only be set up for T2S-in investor CSDs, pointing to a
                                             T2S-in technical issuer CSD.

                                             For a given investor CSD and a given ISIN, only one link (either default or al-
                                                  ternative) should point to a given technical issuer CSD.

                                             For a given investor CSD, the technical issuer CSD may be different for each
                                                    security. It is in most cases the issuer CSD of the security.

                                      The issuer CSD sets a CSD link with itself as issuer. This link cannot be an al-
                                                 ternative one, it is always a default one.

                                           (See section Configuration of securities accounts for cross-CSD settlement and
                                                external CSD settlement [ 97])

 3    This set-up is used by T2S to derive the realignment chain applicable to matched Settlement Instructions
 4    starting either from both investor CSDs (delivering and receiving) up to the issuer CSD(s) of the traded secu-
 5     rities when default links are used, or from the delivering investor CSD up to the receiving investor CSD (or
 6    vice versa) when alternative links are used.

1.6.1.11 Linked Instructions


 2    1.6.1.11.1 Concept

 3   T2S provides the functionality to link Settlement Instruction(s) and/or Settlement Restriction(s) together.
 4   The aim is to submit such linked instructions to specific rules during business validation, eligibility or settle-
 5   ment application processes.

 6    Settlement Instructions and Settlement Restrictions can be linked together either via a link specified by a
 7   T2S Actor or via a link generated automatically by T2S.


 8    1.6.1.11.2 Overview

 9    Settlement Instructions linked via an indicator, a Pool Reference specified by a T2S Actor aim to cover the
10    settlement of specific operations such as coupon stripping/reattachment, baskets of collateral etc.

11   They are linked by the means of a before (BEFO), an after (AFTE) or a with (WITH) link, leading to specifici-
12    ty at their business validation, eligibility or settlement application processes.

13    Settlement Instructions linked automatically by T2S aim to cover the settlement of operations such as rea-
14    lignment, auto-collateralisation, corporate rebalancing liquidity, etc.

15   T2S ensures in those cases the settlement on an all-or-none basis of the initial Settlement Instruction to-
16    gether with the T2S generated Settlement Instruction for realignment, for auto-collateralisation or the T2S
17    generated liquidity transfer for corporate rebalancing liquidity etc.


18    1.6.1.11.3 Link specified by T2S Actor

19   MeanstolinkinstructionsbyT2SActor

20   A T2S Actor links Settlement Instruction(s) and/or Settlement Restriction(s) together by making the use of:

21         l A processing position code corresponding to:

22      – [INFO] Information, for information purpose. There is no processing in T2S behind this code;

23      – [BEFO] Before, which means that a Settlement Instruction or Settlement Restriction is to be settled
24          before or at least at the same time as the linked Settlement Instruction or Settlement Restriction;

25      – [AFTE] After, which means that a Settlement Instruction or Settlement Restriction is to be settled af-
26           ter or at least at the same time as the linked Settlement Instruction or Settlement Restriction;

27      – [WITH] All-or-none, which means that a Settlement Instruction, or Settlement Restriction is to be set-
28           tled at the same time as the linked Settlement Instruction or Settlement Restriction;

29         l A Pool Reference;

30    With the use of a processing position code, a T2S Actor:

31         l  Can link together:

32      – Two Settlement Instructions;

33      – Two Settlement Restrictions;

34      – One Settlement Instruction with one Settlement Restriction;


                                                                                            Page 442 of 2017

 1      – One Settlement Instruction or Settlement Restriction can be executed before, after or at the same
 2          time as an existing pool, by linking the instruction to any instruction that belongs to that pool, through
 3         a processing position code WITH, AFTE or BEFO and the reference of the linked instruction. In this
 4          case, no Pool Reference is needed.

 5      – Settlement Instruction(s) and/or Settlement Restriction(s) can be linked whatever the type (deliv-
 6           ery/receipt), the ISIN code or the Intended Settlement Date, provided that the links do not contradict
 7         each other (See Table 79 - Set-up or increase of blocking, reservation or earmarking on securities
 8          [ 534]).

 9         l  Cannot link together:

10      – A Liquidity Transfer with a Settlement Instruction or a Settlement Restriction;

11      – A T2S internally generated Settlement Instruction.

12   ProcesstolinkinstructionsbyT2SActor

13         l A T2S Actor can create, update or cancel the link of a Settlement Instruction or Settlement Restriction if
14         this Settlement Instruction or Settlement Restriction is compliant with the validation checks (See Table
15      71 - Rules applying to linked Settlement Instructions/Settlement Restrictions [ 448]).

16         l  To create a link, the T2S Actor sends a Settlement Instruction/Settlement Restriction including:

17      – A processing position code (e.g. WITH as example below)

18      – The reference of the linked instruction with the T2S Instruction Reference or the T2S Actor Instruction
19          Reference.

20         l   If the T2S Actor Instruction Reference is provided, T2S also requires the Reference Owner BIC of the
21       Linked Instruction (Instructing Party BIC). In case the instruction does not include this field, T2S does
22       not create the link and the instruction is rejected (i.e. no processing position code is taken by default).
23      To identify univocally a Party in T2S, two BICs are needed (Party BIC+Parent BIC), and there is no field
24         in the message for informing the Parent BIC of the Reference Owner: in order to identify the relevant
25        Party in T2S for the Reference Owner BIC, T2S considers by default the Reference Owner BIC and the
26      CSD (or NCB) of the Instructing Party of the instruction stating the link 243.

27         l   If a T2S actor wants to make use of linkages across several instructions send to T2S via different CSDs
28       he holds accounts with (or NCBs in case of Settlement Restrictions on cash), the T2S actor has to make
29       use of the T2S reference.





     _________________________


        243   In case the Reference Owner BIC relates to a CSD that is also defined as CSD Participant of itself, T2S will consider the CSD as the relevant Party
                    in T2S for the Reference Owner BIC.

3   To update a link (e.g. changing the link from WITH to BEFO as example below), it is necessary first to unlink
4    the Settlement Instruction/Settlement Restriction through an Amendment Instruction, which linkage type
5   must contain the value UNLK and which processing position code must be the same as the one specified in
6    the referenced instruction. In a second step, the T2S Actor has to send another Amendment Instruction
7    which linkage type must contain the value LINK with the new processing position code (e.g. BEFO).
