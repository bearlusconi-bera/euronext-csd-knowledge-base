10    1.6.1.2.1 Concept

11   T2S Matching process compares the settlement details of Settlement Instructions provided by the deliverer
12   and the receiver of securities to ensure that both parties agree on the settlement terms of the transaction in
13   a standardised way, according to the T2S rules, which are compliant with the European Central Securities
14    Depositories Association (ECSDA) and the European Securities Forum (ESF) matching proposals.

 3    1.6.1.2.2 Overview

 4   T2S provides T2S Actors matching services for Settlement Instructions that require to be matched in T2S
 5     (i.e. all Settlement Instructions except the Settlement Instructions with Match status “Matched” regardless
 6    their ISO indicator, ISO transaction code (e.g. CORP) or hold status(es)).

 7    Settlement Restrictions, Maintenance instructions, Realignment instructions, Auto-collaterisation instructions,
 8   Reimbursement auto-collaterisation instructions and Liquidity transfers do not go through the T2S matching
 9    process. The matching of Cancellation Instructions does not follow the rules presented in this section and is
10    presented in section Instruction Cancellation [ 280]).

11   T2S allows CSDs and CSD participants to send already matched instructions Cross-CSD and Intra CSD. In-
12    structions that enter into T2S as already matched are created with the matching fields as if they were
13   matched in T2S (i.e. follow the same matching rules as in T2S).

                                                                                                 Application Processes Description

 1    1.6.1.2.3 Matching process

 2   When a new instruction enters T2S, the matching process compares 194 each of the Mandatory and Non-
 3   mandatory matching fields of the Settlement Instruction with the Settlement Instructions that remain un-
 4   matched in T2S:

 5         l  Mandatory matching fields are those fields that must be present in the instruction and which values
 6       should be the same in both Settlement Instructions except Settlement Amount for DVP/PFOD for which a
 7        tolerance might be applied and for Credit/Debit Code (CRDT/DBIT) and Securities Movement Type Deliv-
 8        er/Receiver (DELI/RECE), whose values match opposite.

 9         l  Non-mandatory matching fields can be Additional or Optional:

10      – Additional matching fields are initially not mandatory but their values have to match when one of the
11          counterparties provides a value for them in its instruction. Consequently, once an Additional matching
12             field is filled in by one Counterparty, the other Counterparty should also fill it in, since a filled-in Addi-
13            tional matching field cannot match with a field with no value.

14      – In case of Optional matching fields, a filled-in field may match with a field with no value (unlike Addi-
15            tional matching fields), but when both Parties provide a value, the values have to match.

16   Depending on the Transaction Type T2S considers some fields mandatory or not, as described in the table
17    below. The following tables and illustrations provide examples of the use of the mandatory, optional and
18    additional fields in the matching process.

        194   Upper and lower case letters are considered as different when comparing the values of two different instructions. In case a given matching field is
                      filled in two different instructions with the same reference but a different combination of upper and lower case letters, this matching field is not
                 subject to matching.

 7     If all the Matching fields on both instructions match, except for the Settlement Amount, T2S checks if the
 8    difference between both Settlement Amounts is compliant with the tolerance amount configured in T2S.

 9    This tolerance amount set up in T2S has two different bands per currency, depending on the cash counter-
10    value. ECSDA proposal for Euro is the following:

                   > EUR 100.000                                    EUR 25

 3    In case there is more than one potentially matching Settlement Instruction, T2S chooses the one having the
 4    smallest Settlement Amount difference. If there is more than one potentially matching Settlement Instruc-
 5    tion with the same Settlement Amount, T2S chooses the one with the closest entry time in T2S. When Set-
 6    tlement Instructions with different Settlement Amount are matched, the amount that T2S submits for set-
 7    tlement as Matched Settlement Amount is the Settlement Amount indicated by the Deliverer of the securi-
 8     ties.

 9    After successful matching of both instructions, the T2S Actors receive a Status Advice message as described
10     in section Send Settlement Instruction. This Status Advice will also contain the T2S Matching Reference as-
11    signed to both Settlement Instructions that have been matched by T2S and the T2S Reference and Account
12   Owner Reference of the counterparty´s instruction. Interested parties can also be informed depending on
13    their message subscription preferences (see Section Status Management [ 653] and section Message sub-
14    scription [ 135]).

15    In case the Settlement Instruction does not match after the first attempt, T2S sends a Settlement Al-
16    legement message (after having waited a certain period of time) to the Counterparty informing that there is
17   a Settlement Instruction alleged against it. The Allegement process is described below (See section Al-
18    legement [ 271]), the dialogue is reflected in section Send Settlement Instruction.

19   T2S automatically cancels Settlement Instructions that remain unmatched after a certain period of time (See
20    section Instruction Cancellation [ 280] and section Instructions Recycling [ 296]).

1.6.1.8 Posting


 2    1.6.1.8.1 Concept

 3   The posting application process checks if the settlement of Settlement Instructions, Settlement Restrictions
 4   and Liquidity Transfers can be achieved considering their eligibility to settlement and the available resources.

 5    In case of high concentration of Settlement Instructions on the same resource (i.e. debiting the same DCA,
 6    debiting or crediting the same SAC not allowed to be negative), the Settlement Instructions could be
 7   grouped without any business links between one another.

 8     It may resort to the optimising application process if needed for the settlement (See section Optimising
 9    [ 335]).

10   When the check is satisfactory, the posting application process updates the cash balance, securities position
11   and limit headroom, resulting in the irrevocability of the settlement.

10    1.6.1.2.1 Concept

11   T2S Matching process compares the settlement details of Settlement Instructions provided by the deliverer
12   and the receiver of securities to ensure that both parties agree on the settlement terms of the transaction in
13   a standardised way, according to the T2S rules, which are compliant with the European Central Securities
14    Depositories Association (ECSDA) and the European Securities Forum (ESF) matching proposals.

 3    1.6.1.2.2 Overview

 4   T2S provides T2S Actors matching services for Settlement Instructions that require to be matched in T2S
 5     (i.e. all Settlement Instructions except the Settlement Instructions with Match status “Matched” regardless
 6    their ISO indicator, ISO transaction code (e.g. CORP) or hold status(es)).

 7    Settlement Restrictions, Maintenance instructions, Realignment instructions, Auto-collaterisation instructions,
 8   Reimbursement auto-collaterisation instructions and Liquidity transfers do not go through the T2S matching
 9    process. The matching of Cancellation Instructions does not follow the rules presented in this section and is
10    presented in section Instruction Cancellation [ 280]).

11   T2S allows CSDs and CSD participants to send already matched instructions Cross-CSD and Intra CSD. In-
12    structions that enter into T2S as already matched are created with the matching fields as if they were
13   matched in T2S (i.e. follow the same matching rules as in T2S).

                                                                                                 Application Processes Description

 1    1.6.1.2.3 Matching process

 2   When a new instruction enters T2S, the matching process compares 194 each of the Mandatory and Non-
 3   mandatory matching fields of the Settlement Instruction with the Settlement Instructions that remain un-
 4   matched in T2S:

 5         l  Mandatory matching fields are those fields that must be present in the instruction and which values
 6       should be the same in both Settlement Instructions except Settlement Amount for DVP/PFOD for which a
 7        tolerance might be applied and for Credit/Debit Code (CRDT/DBIT) and Securities Movement Type Deliv-
 8        er/Receiver (DELI/RECE), whose values match opposite.

 9         l  Non-mandatory matching fields can be Additional or Optional:

10      – Additional matching fields are initially not mandatory but their values have to match when one of the
11          counterparties provides a value for them in its instruction. Consequently, once an Additional matching
12             field is filled in by one Counterparty, the other Counterparty should also fill it in, since a filled-in Addi-
13            tional matching field cannot match with a field with no value.

14      – In case of Optional matching fields, a filled-in field may match with a field with no value (unlike Addi-
15            tional matching fields), but when both Parties provide a value, the values have to match.

16   Depending on the Transaction Type T2S considers some fields mandatory or not, as described in the table
17    below. The following tables and illustrations provide examples of the use of the mandatory, optional and
18    additional fields in the matching process.

        194   Upper and lower case letters are considered as different when comparing the values of two different instructions. In case a given matching field is
                      filled in two different instructions with the same reference but a different combination of upper and lower case letters, this matching field is not
                 subject to matching.

 7     If all the Matching fields on both instructions match, except for the Settlement Amount, T2S checks if the
 8    difference between both Settlement Amounts is compliant with the tolerance amount configured in T2S.

 9    This tolerance amount set up in T2S has two different bands per currency, depending on the cash counter-
10    value. ECSDA proposal for Euro is the following:

                   > EUR 100.000                                    EUR 25

 3    In case there is more than one potentially matching Settlement Instruction, T2S chooses the one having the
 4    smallest Settlement Amount difference. If there is more than one potentially matching Settlement Instruc-
 5    tion with the same Settlement Amount, T2S chooses the one with the closest entry time in T2S. When Set-
 6    tlement Instructions with different Settlement Amount are matched, the amount that T2S submits for set-
 7    tlement as Matched Settlement Amount is the Settlement Amount indicated by the Deliverer of the securi-
 8     ties.

 9    After successful matching of both instructions, the T2S Actors receive a Status Advice message as described
10     in section Send Settlement Instruction. This Status Advice will also contain the T2S Matching Reference as-
11    signed to both Settlement Instructions that have been matched by T2S and the T2S Reference and Account
12   Owner Reference of the counterparty´s instruction. Interested parties can also be informed depending on
13    their message subscription preferences (see Section Status Management [ 653] and section Message sub-
14    scription [ 135]).

15    In case the Settlement Instruction does not match after the first attempt, T2S sends a Settlement Al-
16    legement message (after having waited a certain period of time) to the Counterparty informing that there is
17   a Settlement Instruction alleged against it. The Allegement process is described below (See section Al-
18    legement [ 271]), the dialogue is reflected in section Send Settlement Instruction.

19   T2S automatically cancels Settlement Instructions that remain unmatched after a certain period of time (See
20    section Instruction Cancellation [ 280] and section Instructions Recycling [ 296]).

1.6.1.8 Posting


 2    1.6.1.8.1 Concept

 3   The posting application process checks if the settlement of Settlement Instructions, Settlement Restrictions
 4   and Liquidity Transfers can be achieved considering their eligibility to settlement and the available resources.

 5    In case of high concentration of Settlement Instructions on the same resource (i.e. debiting the same DCA,
 6    debiting or crediting the same SAC not allowed to be negative), the Settlement Instructions could be
 7   grouped without any business links between one another.

 8     It may resort to the optimising application process if needed for the settlement (See section Optimising
 9    [ 335]).

10   When the check is satisfactory, the posting application process updates the cash balance, securities position
11   and limit headroom, resulting in the irrevocability of the settlement.

1.4.2 T2S schedule

18   The T2S schedule is under the control of the T2S operator, for creation of any new timelines, changing
19    and/or deletion of existing time for a period or event. The T2S Operator has the necessary privileges by
20    default to perform temporary or permanent changes to the T2S schedule. T2S ensures that the T2S sched-
21    ule always conforms to the T2S operating day calendar by currency for any changes.

22   T2S manages the transition between the various periods (see section Settlement day high level schedule
23    [ 158]) as an event. For each such event, T2S manages a planned time, a revised time and an effective
24    time:

25         l  The planned time corresponds to the standard schedule applied by default by T2S for every settlement
26       day. The T2S Operator can update this planned time in case of a permanent change in the regular
27        schedule;

28         l  The revised time is the foreseen time for the current settlement day, which usually coincides with the
29       planned time except when a delay has occurred. In contingency situations, the T2S Operator updates
30       the revised time while the planned time remains unchanged;

                                                                                               General Features of T2S
                                                                                                         Settlement Day

 1         l  The effective time is the time of the actual occurrence of the event during the current settlement day.

 2   T2S foresees the maintenance of individual T2S settlement currency dependent cut-offs and events. Howev-
 3     er, the T2S operator manages the overall processing of a settlement day based on a common T2S schedule
 4    configured for each T2S settlement currency. There is no schedule of a settlement day defined per currency
 5     in T2S, but distinct individual cut-offs and events per currency are defined.

 6    This multi-currency configuration allows for some flexibility within the boundaries of the real-time settlement
 7    closure (start of cut-off phase with DVP cut-off at 16:00 hrs CET and end of cut-off phase at 18:00 hrs CET
 8    with FOP cut-off).

 9   The T2S Operator is entitled to change some cut-offs and events (deadlines for receiving Settlement Instruc-
10    tions/Settlement Restrictions for same day settlement) of a settlement day. This can be done independently
11    for a T2S settlement currency, in exceptional circumstances or contingency situations, based on a request
12    from the relevant T2S dependent external system (eg. RTGS, CSD platform, CMS). This exceptional proce-
13    dure is to be defined in the T2S Manual of Operational Procedure (T2S MOP). These currency dependent
14    cut-offs and events are specific events within the T2S daily schedule that have a cash component and are
15    not a cut-off related to the T2S centralised processing such as the start of day and end of day. Such curren-
16    cy dependent cut-offs and events are:

17         l DVP cut-off (IDVP / EDVP) –remains harmonised for all currencies at 16h00;

18         l  Cash Settlement Restriction cut-off;

19         l  Settlement restrictions release

20         l  Reimbursement of intraday credit

21         l BATM (Bilaterally Agreed Treasury Management) cut-off;

22         l CBO (Central Bank Operation) cut-off;

23         l  Optional cash sweep;

24         l  Inbound liquidity transfer cut off;

25         l  Automated cash sweep.

26    This change in cut-offs and events are valid only for the current T2S settlement day. When a currency de-
27    pendent cut-off or event is extended for a currency, then the start of its dependent processes (e.g. cash
28   sweep) is automatically extended for the same currency.

29   T2S allows such a change under the following conditions:

30         l  The sequence and order of events (predecessors and/or successors events) in T2S must remain un-
31       changed, i.e. a currency dependent cut-off cannot be delayed beyond a successor scheduling event if
32         this would have an impact on T2S processing (e.g. a CBO cut-off for Danish Krone cannot be extended
33       beyond the EOD cut-off for T2S, which is the successor in the scheduling). This includes no additions or
34       removals of events, no changes in event ordering and no change in event dependencies;

35         l  In the exceptional cases that T2S experiences a general issue across all currencies, it could be necessary
36        that the T2S Operator would need to extend the EOD cut-off (e.g. the T2S revised times would apply).
37        In this case, T2S ensures the sequence of currency independent cut-offs (securities Settlement Re-

 1         striction cut-off and FOP cut-off) is not changed. The procedures to apply in case of such an event are to
 2       be defined in the T2S MOP.

 3    In the exceptional cases that T2S experiences the arrival of late peak volume transactions on Friday evening
 4    that are not available for settlement at the regular NTS, the T2S Operator would need to process into addi-
 5    tional NTS cycles. The procedure to apply in case of such an event are defined in the T2S MOP.

 6   T2S controls the execution of the processes so that the start of a subsequent process depends on:

 7         l  The completion of the current process and/or;

 8         l  The occurrence of a cut-off.

 9   However, for the start of a process, which is under the dependency of a preceding process and cut-off, T2S
10    ensures that this process cannot start until the completion of the previous process and until the cut-off time
11     is reached.

4.        VP Settlement - Entering of Transfer Orders
4.1        A Settlement Participant  is entitled to instruct Transfer Orders for VP
             Settlement.
4.2         The Settlement of a transaction requires that the parties in the Transfer
             Order specify a validity period that coincide, i.e. the period during which the
               securities transaction concerned may participate in the Settlement.  If a
              Transfer Order has been received by VP prior to the commencement of the
             Settlement period, cf. clause 5.2.3, the first Batch of that Settlement period
                  will be deemed to be the commencement of the validity period.  If the
              Transfer Order is received at a later time the following Batch will be deemed
              to be the commencement of the validity period. A specified validity period
           must as a minimum comprise one Batch and cannot include more than the
             remaining part of the Settlement period.
4.3        Upon receipt of the Transfer Order for VP Settlement, VP will make an
            acknowledgement  available  to  the  instructing  party  and  any  other
               Participants in the Settlement of the transaction in question. As from that
          moment the Transfer Order is deemed "entered" into the VP Clearing and
             Settlement system (the Moment of Entry).

5.        VP Settlement - Matching

5.1         Introduction
5.1.1         For a Transfer Order to be included in a Batch, VP must have received both
              Transfer Orders concerning such transaction and Matching must be completed
              with a positive result before the time of legal effect of such Batch. If a Transfer
             Order designates a specific Batch in which the securities transaction is to be
               settled, Matching will be carried out until the time of legal effect of such Batch.
                   If no specific Batch has been designated, the Transfer Order will be included in
            matching until the time of legal effect of the last Batch, 20 settlement days
               thereafter.

5.2        Matching criteria etc.
5.2.1         After receipt in due time of the last of the two Transfer Orders VP will carry out
             Matching, i.e. a comparison of the information contained in such Transfer
             Orders, cf. the User Guidelines.
5.2.2            If the transaction amount instructed by the receiving Settlement Participant
                differs from that instructed by the delivering Settlement Participant, the



Settlement Rules - Version 13                                                                  | 7 of 17



[PDF page 8]

              transaction amount submitted  in the Transfer Order from the delivering
             Settlement Participant prevails, provided that the difference does not exceed
              VP’s tolerance thresholds for matching as described in the User Guidelines.
5.2.3            If the result of the matching is positive (Match), VP will make the output data
               available to the parties and any other Participants in the Settlement of the
               securities transaction in question.
5.2.4       Two Transfer Orders concerning net settlement which are Matched can provide
             the basis for Settlement of the securities transaction from a chosen intended
             settlement day and until Settlement takes place or the Transfer Orders are
                bilaterally cancelled by both Settlement Participants.

5.3       Moment of irrevocability
5.3.1      When Match of a Transfer Order has occurred the Transfer Order cannot be
              cancelled or revoked unilaterally by either of the Participant or a third party
              (the Moment of Irrevocability). The securities transaction is thus ready for
              settlement. However, if the parties to a transaction so agree, a binding Transfer
             Order can be cancelled by both parties submitting a cancellation transaction
             which must be received by VP prior to the time of legal effect of the Batch in
             which the cancellation is to have effect.

6.        VP Settlement - Settlement

6.1         Settlement terms
6.1.1       Net settlement

6.1.1.1      Settlement takes place when the net effect of all Transfer Orders in the relevant
             Batch is credited or debited to the affected Securities Accounts. In case of SEK
           DVP settlement, credit or debit of the affected Securities Accounts follow by
             Book-entry against the simultaneous recording  of trade amounts on the
              affected cash accounts. All updating will be carried out in the Batch in question
            and information thereon will be made available to the affected Participants.
6.1.2       Real time gross settlement
6.1.2.1       Real rime gross settlement will be carried out by crediting or debiting as the
             case may be the affected VP Accounts. The registration will be carried out
             immediately after the final verification of coverage, and information will be
          made available to the affected Participants.
6.1.3       Trade amounts
6.1.3.1     When the correct payment instructions in respect of the trade amounts have
            been provided by VP to Sveriges Riksbank for SEK Batches, or made available
              to the Cash Account Controller, VP is released of any and all liability as regards
             the further processing of the information and payments.
6.1.4       Settlement in the event of Insolvency Proceedings of a Participant
6.1.4.1      Settlement of Transfer Orders in accordance with clause 6.1 takes place until
           VP has received an  authoritative notice on Insolvency Proceedings  of a
               Participant from the Danish FSA or other public authority, and VP hereafter
              automatically has initiated its insolvency procedures. Though, VP may issue a
               default notice prior to any authoritative notice and request that the Participant
             provide VP with a statement on the Participants current status pursuant to its
              applicable corporate or company law.



Settlement Rules - Version 13                                                                  | 8 of 17

6.1.4.2       Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this clause,  if the insolvency
             procedure referred to in clause 6.1.4.1 is initiated during a Batch, the effects
              thereof will not occur until the current Batch has been concluded. Securities
              transactions concluded in a Batch are final, irrespective of the Insolvency
              Proceedings.
6.1.4.3       In case of Insolvency Proceedings of a Participant distinctions must be made
            between the Participant’s own transactions (″Participant Transactions″ - see
              clause 6.1.5.1) and transactions on behalf of a client of the Participant (″Client
              Transactions″ - see clause 6.1.5 ).
6.1.5         Client Transactions
6.1.5.1       Subject to clause 6.1.4.1 Client Transactions will not be settled as from the
              insolvency procedure referred to in clause 6.1.4.1 is initiated.
6.1.6        Participant Transactions
6.1.6.1       Distinctions must be made between net settlement and  real time gross
              settlement:
               A.   Net settlement:

                       Until 18:00 hours on the date that VP is notified of the Insolvency
                    Proceedings, Transfer Orders submitted by the insolvent Participant that
                  have reach Moment of Entry and where also the relevant corresponding
                     Transfer Orders submitted by counterparties have reach Moment of
                    Entry prior to the notification, will be included in VP's Batches and will
                  be submitted for settlement in accordance with the normal terms for
                    Settlement in Batches.

                            If VP is not informed of the Insolvency Proceedings until after 18:00
                   hours on the date of the Insolvency Proceedings, VP will settle the
                       Participant’s Transfer Orders  until the time VP  is notified and has
                        initiated its insolvency procedure.

               B.   Real time gross settlement:

                       Until 18:00 hours on the date that VP is notified of the Insolvency
                    Proceedings, Transfer Orders submitted by the insolvent Participant that
                  have reach Moment of Entry and where also the relevant corresponding
                     Transfer Orders submitted by counterparties have reach Moment of
                    Entry  prior to the  notification  will be submitted  for settlement  in
                   accordance with the normal terms for Settlement in RTGS.

6.2         Settlement Finality
6.2.1       Net settlement
6.2.1.1     A Transfer Order for Settlement in a Batch is finally settled (unconditional,
              irrevocable and enforceable) as from the moment when the Batch in which the
              Transfer Order is settled is completed (the Moment of Settlement Finality). A
             Batch is completed as of the posting on a net basis of the trade amount, etc.
            and the crediting or debiting of the affected Securities Accounts by Book-entry,
                  cf. clause 6.1 above. The Transfer Order in question attain legal effect as at the
             time of legal effect specified for the Batch in question.
6.2.1.2       In the event of a provisional transfer of securities between VP and a Participant
           who is a CSD, retransfer of such securities prior to the first transfer becoming
                 final is prohibited.

11.1        General
11.1.1      The T2S Settlement services available to Settlement Participants are
              described in detail in the T2S User Detailed Functional Specification and in the

             apply to the Settlement Participant unless the VP Rule Book provides
              otherwise.

11.2       Access rules

              to become a DCP the Settlement Participant must enter into a separate
            agreement with VP.

11.3       T2S Settlement - Transfer Orders

               B.   In case of a DvP, DwP and PFoD transaction, the settlement currency is
                  a T2S Currency, and the transaction is to be settled in central bank
                 money, unless specifically agreed otherwise with VP.

11.4       T2S Accounts
11.4.1      A Settlement Participant must have access to at least one T2S Account with VP,
              unless the Settlement Participant does not need to settle T2S Settlement
             Required Transactions.
11.4.2      A Settlement Participant may in respect of the securities registered on a T2S
             Account use the functionalities blocking, reservation and earmarking as further
              described in the User Guidelines.

11.5       T2S Auto-Collateral
11.5.1        Securities on a T2S Account can be used for T2S Auto-Collateral as agreed with
             VP. This requires that  (i) the Cash Settlement Agent has entered into an
            agreement according to which the securities registered on one or more defined
           T2S Account(s) may be used as collateral for credits granted by the relevant
               central bank in connection with T2S Settlement (referred to as the T2S Auto-
               Collateral agreement), (ii) the Cash Settlement Agent has delivered to VP a
            form stipulating that it wants to use T2S Auto-Collateral, and (iii) that the T2S
             Account has been earmarked for T2S Auto-Collateral by registration of a
                restrictive right in the VP Clearing and Settlement system. The types of
                restrictive rights that may be registered in this respect are described in the
             User Guidelines.
11.5.2      The VP Clearing and Settlement System supports the different T2S Auto-
               Collateral processes which are offered by the T2S System and described in the
           T2S User Guidelines. The T2S Auto-Collateral process depends on the T2S
              Auto-Collateral agreement entered into between the Settlement Participant and
             the relevant central bank. When a Settlement Participant enters into a T2S
              Auto-Collateral agreement the Settlement Participant must initiate the set-up
               of the right account structure with VP, and the central bank must instruct the
           T2S system. Hereafter the T2S Auto-Collateral is handled automatically by the
           T2S system in accordance with the T2S User Guidelines.

11.6        Entering of Transfer Orders, Validation and Pre-Match
11.6.1          All securities registered on a T2S Account may be used for T2S Settlement, and
             cannot be used for VP Settlement, unless the securities are transferred to a VP
             Account. The User Guidelines contain a detailed description of how and when
               securities may be transferred between VP Accounts and T2S Accounts.
11.6.2      A Transfer Order instructed for T2S Settlement is validated by VP upon receipt
                in order to declare it compliant with the technical rules of T2S as set out in the
           T2S User Guidelines. First, VP verifies that the sending party is authorised to
               instruct the Transfer Order via VP. Subsequently, VP applies the validation
                 criteria, and validates  if the mandatory data fields are correctly filled in. A
               detailed description of the information to be reported for validation is contained
                in the User Guidelines.
11.6.3      An unsuccessful validation of a Transfer Order causes a rejection of the Transfer
             Order, and information of the reason for the rejection are generated and sent
              to the submitting party.

11.6.4      Upon a successful validation of a Transfer Order concerning a T2S Transfer, but
               prior to upload of the Transfer Order for entry in the match module on the T2S
              platform, VP will attempt to perform Match outside the T2S platform (a Pre-
             Match), as further described in the User Guidelines. In case of no pre-match,
             the Transfer Order is immediately passed on by VP to the T2S platform for
            Match in the T2S matching module. If the result of the Pre-Match is successful,
           VP will create a new consolidated Transfer Order to T2S for entry in the T2S
            match module as described in the User Guidelines.
11.6.5      The right for VP to conduct Pre-Matches follows from an agreement (the
               Collective Agreement) with the ECB.
11.6.6          If the transaction amount instructed by the receiving Settlement Participant
                differs from that instructed by the delivering Settlement Participant, the
              transaction amount submitted  in the Transfer Order from the delivering
             Settlement Participant prevails, provided that the difference does not exceed
             the T2S tolerance match rules as set out in the T2S User Guidelines.
11.6.7      A Transfer Order, which has been successfully validated and Pre-Matched, is
           deemed "entered" into the VP Clearing and Settlement system at the moment
               at which  it was declared compliant with the technical rules of T2S by VP
              (the Moment of Entry into the System for pre-matched Transfer Orders).
            Whereas a Transfer Order for T2S Settlement, that has not been Pre-Matched,
             but passed on to the T2S System, is deemed “entered” into at the moment at
             which it has been declared compliant with the technical rules of T2S by the T2S
              platform (the Moment of Entry into the System for not pre-matched Transfer
              Orders).
11.6.8      A Transfer Order may be submitted for same day settlement, for settlement up
              to 13 months in advance of the settlement day, and for a settlement day in the
             past if all relevant static data were valid at the past settlement day.
11.6.9      VP supports various T2S  functionalities such as  linking,  partial  delivery,
                prioritization, etc. The functionalities supported by VP are described in the User
              Guidelines.

11.7       Matching on the T2S platform
11.7.1      When a Transfer Order has been given the status “Matched” on the T2S
              platform, irrespectively of whether it has been Pre-Matched or not, the Transfer
             Order  cannot  unilaterally  be  cancelled  or  revoked  (the  Moment  of
                Irrevocability). From the Moment of Irrevocability and until settlement has
             taken place, the functionality “Hold & Release” may, however, be applied by
            each party and the parties may bilaterally agree to cancel their Transfer Orders
                until settlement. This is further described in the User Guidelines.
11.7.2      A Transfer Order that has not been matched will be handled in accordance with
             the Recycling terms set out in the T2S User Guidelines.

11.8        Settlement
11.8.1      General
11.8.1.1     T2S Settlement  is  carried out by  crediting/debiting the T2S Account as
               applicable, and debiting/crediting a linked DCA as applicable. VP is not involved
                in the process of providing cash liquidity on the DCA as lines are handled in the
           payment system by the Cash Settlement Agent and the relevant central bank.
              For FoP Settlement, the DCA is not impacted.

11.8.1.2    A Transfer Order that has been matched but not settled because of lack of
             coverage will be handled in accordance with the recycling terms set out in the
             User Guidelines.
11.8.1.3     Information on Securities Account entries on the T2S platform will be made
               available to the affected Settlement Participants and other relevant parties as
              described in the User Guidelines.
11.8.2      Settlement Finality
11.8.2.1    A Transfer Order is finally settled (unconditional, irrevocable and enforceable)
             as from the account entry (credit) of the securities on the receiving Settlement
               Participant’s Securities Account on the T2S platform (the Moment of Settlement
                Finality). The corresponding account entry will hereafter be mirrored in the VP
              Clearing and Settlement System.
11.8.3      T2S Settlement in the event of Insolvency Proceedings of a Participant
11.8.3.1     Settlement of Transfer Orders in accordance with clause 11.8.1 takes place
                until VP has received an authoritative notice on Insolvency Proceedings of a
             Settlement Participant from the Danish FSA or other public authority, and VP
              hereafter has initiated its T2S insolvency procedures as described below. VP
          may also issue a default notice prior to any authoritative notice and request
              that the Settlement Participant provide VP with a statement on the Settlement
               Participant’s current status pursuant to its applicable corporate or company
              law.
11.8.3.2      Transfer Orders submitted by the insolvent Settlement Participant that have
             reached Moment of Entry and where also the relevant corresponding Transfer
             Orders submitted by counterparties have reached Moment of Entry prior to the
          moment of opening of the Insolvency Proceedings will be attempted settled in
             the T2S system.
11.8.3.3      Transfer Orders that have reached Moment of Entry after the moment of
             opening of the Insolvency Proceedings, but have been matched on the T2S
              platform prior to VP became aware, nor should have been aware of the opening
               of such proceedings, and are for settlement on the same T2S Business Day will
            be attempted settled in the T2S system, but will, however be cancelled  if
              unsettled at the end of the day.
11.8.3.4      Transfer  Orders  not  covered  in  clauses  11.8.3.2 and  11.8.3.3  will be
             immediately cancelled after VP becomes aware of the opening of the Insolvency
              Proceedings.
11.8.3.5      In case  of insolvency  of a Settlement Participant VP  will make relevant
              insolvency information available to relevant parties on the T2S settlement
              platform in accordance with the T2S User Guidelines and European Securities
            and Markets Authority’s “Guidelines on CSD participants default rules and
              procedures”.
11.8.3.6     Any actions taken by VP in the event of the opening of Insolvency Proceedings
              against a Settlement Participant will be executed in accordance with the T2S
             User Guidelines on a case-by-case basis.
