1.6.1.9.3 Partial Settlement

 2   Concept

 3   T2S provides partial settlement process, i.e. settles only a fraction of the original quantity or amount when
 4     full settlement is not possible due to lack of securities or cash, in order to increase the volume and value of
 5    settlement.

 6   Overview

 7     Partial settlement applies under conditions and procedures that differ whether they apply to:

 8         l  Settlement Instructions;

 9         l  Settlement Restrictions;

10         l  Liquidity transfers.

11    Partialsettlementprocess

12     Partial settlement process for Settlement Instructions

13   A Settlement Instruction is partially settled 224, in case there are insufficient securities to settle the full quan-
14     tity and provided the following conditions are met:

15         l  The partial settlement window is currently running; 225

16         l  The Settlement Instructions are eligible to settle partially;

17         l  The partial settlement threshold criteria are fulfilled.

18    Partial settlement window

19     Partial settlement is active in T2S within the dedicated partial settlement windows 226.

20    Partial settlement eligibility

21   The settlement eligibility depends notably on conditions set by the T2S parties on their matched Settlement
22    Instructions.

23   A matched pair of Settlement Instructions is eligible to partial settlement, when these Settlement Instruc-
24    tions are entered by the T2S parties with the following characteristics:

25         l  They are related to Free Of Payment or to Delivery Versus Payment or Delivery With Payment; 227

26         l  The partial settlement indicator is not set to "No" in any of the Settlement Instructions;

27         l  They are not linked to any other Settlement Instruction or Settlement Restriction by the T2S parties by a
28         link type “Before”, “After” “With” or by a pool reference.

     _________________________


        224    Partial settlement is triggered only in case of lack of securities (i.e. lack of securities only or lack of securities and cash) but not in case of lack of
               cash only.

        225    Partially released Settlement Instructions can be submitted for settlement attempts for the total partially released quantity also when the partial
                settlement window is not running. Partially released Settlement Instructions can be submitted for settlement attempts for a part of the partially
                released quantity only when the partial settlement window is running.

        226   For details about the schedule of partial settlement window, see section Settlement Day [ 155]

        227    Including such Settlement Instructions which are on Party Hold and have been partially released.

 1     Partial settlement of Partially Released Settlement Instructions

 2   A Settlement Instruction on Party Hold may be partially released to allow the partial settlement of a specified
 3    quantity. This Partially Released Settlement Instruction must conform to all the conditions of partial settle-
 4   ment as for any other Settlement Instruction. During the real-time period the partial settlement of Partially
 5    Released Settlement Instructions can occur outside a partial settlement window for the total partially re-
 6    leased quantity, as well as during a partial settlement window for the total or part of the partially released
 7    quantity and until the relevant cut-off time (partial release is only valid for the current business day) at
 8    which point the partial release will be cancelled and the underlying Settlement Instruction set back on Party
 9    Hold for the full unsettled quantity. For partial release to be considered during sequence C2SX of the night
10    time settlement the partial release must occur as of the start of day.

11    Partial settlement threshold

12     Partial settlement is conditioned by thresholds, below which it cannot apply, and that are determined in T2S
13   when the settlement occurs, on the basis of the following content of the Settlement Instructions:

14         l  The instruction type (FOP or DVP or DWP);

15         l  The instruction threshold type (see table below);

16         l  The underlying ISIN;

17         l  The currency of the cash amount of the Settlement Instruction.

18   These contents of the Settlement Instructions allow T2S to determine the type of partial settlement thresh-
19    old applicable on the Settlement Instructions being processed. The following types of partial settlement
20    thresholds are possible:

21         l A threshold in “quantity”: meaning the partial settlement cannot take place for a quantity lower than an
22        applicable value;

23         l A threshold in “cash value”: meaning the partial settlement cannot take place for an amount lower than
24      an applicable value.25

 3   The parameters determining the threshold applicable above are set:

 4         l  By T2S Actors from the content of their Settlement Instructions for the instruction type and instruction
 5        threshold type mentioned in the table above;

 6         l  By the T2S Operator inside the Static Data for the applicable threshold in cash value. This parameter is
 7      common to all T2S Parties, and set per T2S settlement currency, and separate for unit-quoted or nomi-
 8        nal quoted ISIN;

 9         l  By the T2S Actors in charge of the administration of the relevant ISIN in the Static Data for the applica-
10        ble threshold in quantity (See section Concept of securities in T2S [ 71]).

11    Partial settlement procedure

12    Settlement Instructions are submitted to a full settlement attempt before being submitted to a partial set-
13    tlement attempt. 229

14    In case the Settlement Instruction does not settle, the Settlement Instruction is submitted to Optimising
15    application process. The Optimising application process tries to settle the failed Settlement Instruction with
16    other Settlement Instructions in T2S based on different technical optimisations. In case the Optimising appli-
17    cation process is not able to find a solution for a full settlement, T2S tries to submit the Settlement Instruc-
18    tion for partial settlement provided the above conditions are met.

     _________________________


        228   Cash value thresholds are not considered for FOP regardless of the partial settlement threshold type (partial settlement indicator PARC, PART)
                defined within the settlement instruction. This also applies for FOP instructions related to a foreign currency transaction (non-EUR amount).

        229    Partially Released Settlement Instructions are only submitted to partial settlement attempts for the released quantity.

1.4.4.4 Real-time settlement (RTS)

 4    This section presents the real-time settlement processes in the T2S settlement day. The real-time settlement
 5    period starts after the end of the night-time settlement and is followed by the end of day period.

 6    In case the NTS completes before 3.00 from Mondays to Fridays and before 2.30 on Saturdays, real-time
 7    settlement period begins before the start of the maintenance window.

 8   The real-time settlement period includes:

 9         l  The real-time settlement preparation;

10         l  The real-time settlement with the five partial settlement windows to optimise maximum value and vol-
11      umes of settlement transactions, which are unsettled because of lack of securities:

12      – The first partial settlement window between 08:00 and 08:30;

13      – The second partial settlement window between 10:00 and 10:15;

14      – The third partial settlement window between 12:00 and 12:15;

15      – The fourth partial settlement window between 14:00 and 14:15;

16      – The fifth partial settlement window is 30 minutes before the beginning of the DVP cut-off time, then
17         between 15:30 and 16:05 or the closure of both DVP cut-offs (whichever comes first).

18   The previously unsettled Settlement Instructions and Settlement Restrictions from night-time settlement are
19    attempted for settlement in the real-time settlement period with the arrival of new resources (securities for
20    delivery, securities in positions earmarked available for collateral, cash). 143 Additionally T2S performs a set-
21    tlement attempt for any new intraday Settlement Instructions, Settlement Restrictions and liquidity transfers
22    validated and accepted during real-time settlement period;

23         l  The real-time settlement closure with different cut-offs and events for different Settlement Instructions,
24       Settlement Restrictions and liquidity transfers categories.


     _________________________


        143   During the regular recycling, the mechanism ensures that a transaction will not be recycled if the transaction sent just before has not been at-
               tempted for settlement. This serialization process will concern all transactions with age >= 3 selected by the Regular Recycling process following a
                   credit in securities or cash or an increase in CMB headroom or limit, guaranteeing that an older transaction will be attempted before a younger one
                with the same priority. The transactions selected by one given recycling process will be segregated into eight groups, depending on their priority
              and age:

               Group 1         Group 2         Group 3         Group 4         Group 5         Group 6         Group 7         Group 8
                    Priority 1           Priority 1           Priority 2           Priority 2           Priority 3           Priority 3           Priority 4           Priority 4

1.4.2 T2S schedule

18   The T2S schedule is under the control of the T2S operator, for creation of any new timelines, changing
19    and/or deletion of existing time for a period or event. The T2S Operator has the necessary privileges by
20    default to perform temporary or permanent changes to the T2S schedule. T2S ensures that the T2S sched-
21    ule always conforms to the T2S operating day calendar by currency for any changes.

22   T2S manages the transition between the various periods (see section Settlement day high level schedule
23    [ 158]) as an event. For each such event, T2S manages a planned time, a revised time and an effective
24    time:

25         l  The planned time corresponds to the standard schedule applied by default by T2S for every settlement
26       day. The T2S Operator can update this planned time in case of a permanent change in the regular
27        schedule;

28         l  The revised time is the foreseen time for the current settlement day, which usually coincides with the
29       planned time except when a delay has occurred. In contingency situations, the T2S Operator updates
30       the revised time while the planned time remains unchanged;

                                                                                                         Settlement Day

 1         l  The effective time is the time of the actual occurrence of the event during the current settlement day.

 2   T2S foresees the maintenance of individual T2S settlement currency dependent cut-offs and events. Howev-
 3     er, the T2S operator manages the overall processing of a settlement day based on a common T2S schedule
 4    configured for each T2S settlement currency. There is no schedule of a settlement day defined per currency
 5     in T2S, but distinct individual cut-offs and events per currency are defined.

 6    This multi-currency configuration allows for some flexibility within the boundaries of the real-time settlement
 7    closure (start of cut-off phase with DVP cut-off at 16:00 hrs CET and end of cut-off phase at 18:00 hrs CET
 8    with FOP cut-off).

 9   The T2S Operator is entitled to change some cut-offs and events (deadlines for receiving Settlement Instruc-
10    tions/Settlement Restrictions for same day settlement) of a settlement day. This can be done independently
11    for a T2S settlement currency, in exceptional circumstances or contingency situations, based on a request
12    from the relevant T2S dependent external system (eg. RTGS, CSD platform, CMS). This exceptional proce-
13    dure is to be defined in the T2S Manual of Operational Procedure (T2S MOP). These currency dependent
14    cut-offs and events are specific events within the T2S daily schedule that have a cash component and are
15    not a cut-off related to the T2S centralised processing such as the start of day and end of day. Such curren-
16    cy dependent cut-offs and events are:

17         l DVP cut-off (IDVP / EDVP) –remains harmonised for all currencies at 16h00;

18         l  Cash Settlement Restriction cut-off;

19         l  Settlement restrictions release

20         l  Reimbursement of intraday credit

21         l BATM (Bilaterally Agreed Treasury Management) cut-off;

22         l CBO (Central Bank Operation) cut-off;

23         l  Optional cash sweep;

24         l  Inbound liquidity transfer cut off;

25         l  Automated cash sweep.

26    This change in cut-offs and events are valid only for the current T2S settlement day. When a currency de-
27    pendent cut-off or event is extended for a currency, then the start of its dependent processes (e.g. cash
28   sweep) is automatically extended for the same currency.

29   T2S allows such a change under the following conditions:

30         l  The sequence and order of events (predecessors and/or successors events) in T2S must remain un-
31       changed, i.e. a currency dependent cut-off cannot be delayed beyond a successor scheduling event if
32         this would have an impact on T2S processing (e.g. a CBO cut-off for Danish Krone cannot be extended
33       beyond the EOD cut-off for T2S, which is the successor in the scheduling). This includes no additions or
34       removals of events, no changes in event ordering and no change in event dependencies;

35         l  In the exceptional cases that T2S experiences a general issue across all currencies, it could be necessary
36        that the T2S Operator would need to extend the EOD cut-off (e.g. the T2S revised times would apply).
37        In this case, T2S ensures the sequence of currency independent cut-offs (securities Settlement Re-

 2       be defined in the T2S MOP.

 3    In the exceptional cases that T2S experiences the arrival of late peak volume transactions on Friday evening
 4    that are not available for settlement at the regular NTS, the T2S Operator would need to process into addi-
 5    tional NTS cycles. The procedure to apply in case of such an event are defined in the T2S MOP.

 6   T2S controls the execution of the processes so that the start of a subsequent process depends on:

 7         l  The completion of the current process and/or;

 8         l  The occurrence of a cut-off.

 9   However, for the start of a process, which is under the dependency of a preceding process and cut-off, T2S
10    ensures that this process cannot start until the completion of the previous process and until the cut-off time
11     is reached.

1.4.4.1 Start of day (SOD)

 5    This section presents the start of day processes.

 6   The SOD period starts after the successful completion of the previous EOD period and after 18:45, and is
 7    followed by the night-time settlement period.

 8   The SOD period concentrates on the change of T2S business date, the taking of the common Snapshot and
 9    preparation of the night-time settlement period. It includes the processing of the feeds from collateral man-
10   agement systems (CMS) and payment/settlement banks for the reference prices and eligible assets (for val-
11    uation purposes).

1.4.2 T2S schedule

18   The T2S schedule is under the control of the T2S operator, for creation of any new timelines, changing
19    and/or deletion of existing time for a period or event. The T2S Operator has the necessary privileges by
20    default to perform temporary or permanent changes to the T2S schedule. T2S ensures that the T2S sched-
21    ule always conforms to the T2S operating day calendar by currency for any changes.

22   T2S manages the transition between the various periods (see section Settlement day high level schedule
23    [ 158]) as an event. For each such event, T2S manages a planned time, a revised time and an effective
24    time:

25         l  The planned time corresponds to the standard schedule applied by default by T2S for every settlement
26       day. The T2S Operator can update this planned time in case of a permanent change in the regular
27        schedule;

28         l  The revised time is the foreseen time for the current settlement day, which usually coincides with the
29       planned time except when a delay has occurred. In contingency situations, the T2S Operator updates
30       the revised time while the planned time remains unchanged;

                                                                                                         Settlement Day

 1         l  The effective time is the time of the actual occurrence of the event during the current settlement day.

 2   T2S foresees the maintenance of individual T2S settlement currency dependent cut-offs and events. Howev-
 3     er, the T2S operator manages the overall processing of a settlement day based on a common T2S schedule
 4    configured for each T2S settlement currency. There is no schedule of a settlement day defined per currency
 5     in T2S, but distinct individual cut-offs and events per currency are defined.

 6    This multi-currency configuration allows for some flexibility within the boundaries of the real-time settlement
 7    closure (start of cut-off phase with DVP cut-off at 16:00 hrs CET and end of cut-off phase at 18:00 hrs CET
 8    with FOP cut-off).

 9   The T2S Operator is entitled to change some cut-offs and events (deadlines for receiving Settlement Instruc-
10    tions/Settlement Restrictions for same day settlement) of a settlement day. This can be done independently
11    for a T2S settlement currency, in exceptional circumstances or contingency situations, based on a request
12    from the relevant T2S dependent external system (eg. RTGS, CSD platform, CMS). This exceptional proce-
13    dure is to be defined in the T2S Manual of Operational Procedure (T2S MOP). These currency dependent
14    cut-offs and events are specific events within the T2S daily schedule that have a cash component and are
15    not a cut-off related to the T2S centralised processing such as the start of day and end of day. Such curren-
16    cy dependent cut-offs and events are:

17         l DVP cut-off (IDVP / EDVP) –remains harmonised for all currencies at 16h00;

18         l  Cash Settlement Restriction cut-off;

19         l  Settlement restrictions release

20         l  Reimbursement of intraday credit

21         l BATM (Bilaterally Agreed Treasury Management) cut-off;

22         l CBO (Central Bank Operation) cut-off;

23         l  Optional cash sweep;

24         l  Inbound liquidity transfer cut off;

25         l  Automated cash sweep.

26    This change in cut-offs and events are valid only for the current T2S settlement day. When a currency de-
27    pendent cut-off or event is extended for a currency, then the start of its dependent processes (e.g. cash
28   sweep) is automatically extended for the same currency.

29   T2S allows such a change under the following conditions:

30         l  The sequence and order of events (predecessors and/or successors events) in T2S must remain un-
31       changed, i.e. a currency dependent cut-off cannot be delayed beyond a successor scheduling event if
32         this would have an impact on T2S processing (e.g. a CBO cut-off for Danish Krone cannot be extended
33       beyond the EOD cut-off for T2S, which is the successor in the scheduling). This includes no additions or
34       removals of events, no changes in event ordering and no change in event dependencies;

35         l  In the exceptional cases that T2S experiences a general issue across all currencies, it could be necessary
36        that the T2S Operator would need to extend the EOD cut-off (e.g. the T2S revised times would apply).
37        In this case, T2S ensures the sequence of currency independent cut-offs (securities Settlement Re-



                                                                                            Page 157 of 2017

 1         striction cut-off and FOP cut-off) is not changed. The procedures to apply in case of such an event are to
 2       be defined in the T2S MOP.

 3    In the exceptional cases that T2S experiences the arrival of late peak volume transactions on Friday evening
 4    that are not available for settlement at the regular NTS, the T2S Operator would need to process into addi-
 5    tional NTS cycles. The procedure to apply in case of such an event are defined in the T2S MOP.

 6   T2S controls the execution of the processes so that the start of a subsequent process depends on:

 7         l  The completion of the current process and/or;

 8         l  The occurrence of a cut-off.

 9   However, for the start of a process, which is under the dependency of a preceding process and cut-off, T2S
10    ensures that this process cannot start until the completion of the previous process and until the cut-off time
11     is reached.

EXCERPT (§1.4.4.1; PDF 163):
1.4.4.1 Start of day (SOD)

 5    This section presents the start of day processes.

 6   The SOD period starts after the successful completion of the previous EOD period and after 18:45, and is
 7    followed by the night-time settlement period.

 8   The SOD period concentrates on the change of T2S business date, the taking of the common Snapshot and
 9    preparation of the night-time settlement period. It includes the processing of the feeds from collateral man-
10   agement systems (CMS) and payment/settlement banks for the reference prices and eligible assets (for val-
11    uation purposes).
