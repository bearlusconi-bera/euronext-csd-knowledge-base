1.4.2 T2S schedule

18   The T2S schedule is under the control of the T2S operator, for creation of any new timelines, changing
19    and/or deletion of existing time for a period or event. The T2S Operator has the necessary privileges by
20    default to perform temporary or permanent changes to the T2S schedule. T2S ensures that the T2S sched-
21    ule always conforms to the T2S operating day calendar by currency for any changes.

22   T2S manages the transition between the various periods (see section Settlement day high level schedule
23    [ 158]) as an event. For each such event, T2S manages a planned time, a revised time and an effective
24    time:

25         l  The planned time corresponds to the standard schedule applied by default by T2S for every settlement
26       day. The T2S Operator can update this planned time in case of a permanent change in the regular
27        schedule;

28         l  The revised time is the foreseen time for the current settlement day, which usually coincides with the
29       planned time except when a delay has occurred. In contingency situations, the T2S Operator updates
30       the revised time while the planned time remains unchanged;

                                                                                                         Settlement Day

 1         l  The effective time is the time of the actual occurrence of the event during the current settlement day.

 2   T2S foresees the maintenance of individual T2S settlement currency dependent cut-offs and events. Howev-
 3     er, the T2S operator manages the overall processing of a settlement day based on a common T2S schedule
 4    configured for each T2S settlement currency. There is no schedule of a settlement day defined per currency
 5     in T2S, but distinct individual cut-offs and events per currency are defined.

 6    This multi-currency configuration allows for some flexibility within the boundaries of the real-time settlement
 7    closure (start of cut-off phase with DVP cut-off at 16:00 hrs CET and end of cut-off phase at 18:00 hrs CET
 8    with FOP cut-off).

 9   The T2S Operator is entitled to change some cut-offs and events (deadlines for receiving Settlement Instruc-
10    tions/Settlement Restrictions for same day settlement) of a settlement day. This can be done independently
11    for a T2S settlement currency, in exceptional circumstances or contingency situations, based on a request
12    from the relevant T2S dependent external system (eg. RTGS, CSD platform, CMS). This exceptional proce-
13    dure is to be defined in the T2S Manual of Operational Procedure (T2S MOP). These currency dependent
14    cut-offs and events are specific events within the T2S daily schedule that have a cash component and are
15    not a cut-off related to the T2S centralised processing such as the start of day and end of day. Such curren-
16    cy dependent cut-offs and events are:

17         l DVP cut-off (IDVP / EDVP) –remains harmonised for all currencies at 16h00;

18         l  Cash Settlement Restriction cut-off;

19         l  Settlement restrictions release

20         l  Reimbursement of intraday credit

21         l BATM (Bilaterally Agreed Treasury Management) cut-off;

22         l CBO (Central Bank Operation) cut-off;

23         l  Optional cash sweep;

24         l  Inbound liquidity transfer cut off;

25         l  Automated cash sweep.

26    This change in cut-offs and events are valid only for the current T2S settlement day. When a currency de-
27    pendent cut-off or event is extended for a currency, then the start of its dependent processes (e.g. cash
28   sweep) is automatically extended for the same currency.

29   T2S allows such a change under the following conditions:

30         l  The sequence and order of events (predecessors and/or successors events) in T2S must remain un-
31       changed, i.e. a currency dependent cut-off cannot be delayed beyond a successor scheduling event if
32         this would have an impact on T2S processing (e.g. a CBO cut-off for Danish Krone cannot be extended
33       beyond the EOD cut-off for T2S, which is the successor in the scheduling). This includes no additions or
34       removals of events, no changes in event ordering and no change in event dependencies;

35         l  In the exceptional cases that T2S experiences a general issue across all currencies, it could be necessary
36        that the T2S Operator would need to extend the EOD cut-off (e.g. the T2S revised times would apply).
37        In this case, T2S ensures the sequence of currency independent cut-offs (securities Settlement Re-

 2       be defined in the T2S MOP.

 3    In the exceptional cases that T2S experiences the arrival of late peak volume transactions on Friday evening
 4    that are not available for settlement at the regular NTS, the T2S Operator would need to process into addi-
 5    tional NTS cycles. The procedure to apply in case of such an event are defined in the T2S MOP.

 6   T2S controls the execution of the processes so that the start of a subsequent process depends on:

 7         l  The completion of the current process and/or;

 8         l  The occurrence of a cut-off.

 9   However, for the start of a process, which is under the dependency of a preceding process and cut-off, T2S
10    ensures that this process cannot start until the completion of the previous process and until the cut-off time
11     is reached.

EXCERPT (Article 68; PDF 49–50, printed 48–49):
Article 68 – Acquisition of settlement Instructions

1. Settlement instructions are acquired by the Settlement Service regarding:
      a) individual transactions (DVP or FOP);
      b) bilateral netting of securities and cash balances;
       c) securities and cash balances, netted via interposition of a Central
         Counterparty.
2. During acquisition, the Settlement Services checks:
    ▪ the completeness of the settlement instruction and its formal correctness to
     ensure the ensuing processing by the Service; and
    ▪ the matching of the settlement instruction data with personal data found in
     T2S (common static data), as well as with any restrictions, including the
     matching of the financial instruments involved with the provisions of Article
      86.
3. The validated settlement Instructions are forwarded to the subsequent phases
   of the service. Non-validated Settlement Instructions are rejected.
4. Settlement Instructions can establish that the settlement:
    ▪  is connected to the settlement of linked instructions; or
    ▪  is  conditional on  the  occurrence  of  specific  conditions  outside T2S
      (Conditional Securities Delivery CoSD7).
5. Participants may also specify:
    ▪ the possibility of a partial settlement, within the limits allowed by the T2S
      system’s functionalities; and
    ▪ the rule priority of the settlement instruction entered, within the limits
      allowed by the functionalities of T2S and taking into account that Monte
       Titoli  assigns  priority  to  the  settlement  Instructions  in  which  the
      counterparty is the Italian Ministry of Finance, those involving monetary


7 Conditional securities delivery in T2S refers to a procedure in which the final posting of securities and/or cash is dependent on
the successful completion of an additional action or event external to T2S and confirmed by an administering party.

      policy transactions and those concerning transfer of collateral by the Bank
      of  Italy  and,  subsequently,  those coming from Market Management
     Companies.
6. Participants are informed of the result of the validation process.
EXCERPT (Articles 73–76; PDF 52–53, printed 51–52):
Article 73– Automatic mechanisms for posting Collateral

1.   The participants to the Settlement Service and/or their Agent Banks that
    have previously communicated their intention to avail themselves of the
     automatic mechanisms for posting Collateral must, with the methods and
     time frames provided for in the Instructions, indicate the securities accounts
     and/or the positions that can be used for collateralisation and the exposure
      limits to be considered in the settlement process.
2.   The activation of the collateralisation mechanisms causes the automatic
     generation  of  settlement  instructions by  the Settlement  Service. The
     settlement instructions arising from collateralisation are settled jointly with
     the original Settlement Instructions, relative to which the mechanism for
     posting Collateral was activated.

Article 74 – Processing of the settlement Instructions

1. The settlement process includes a night-time phase and a day-time phase. In
   each phase the Settlement Instructions are processed on a gross basis.
2. In  each  phase,  according  to  the  eligibility  criteria  of  the  settlement
   Instructions, Monte Titoli settles:
      a) the new settlement Instructions entered before each phase during the
         night-time settlement phase and in real-time during the daytime phase,
          including the instructions for realignment and those resulting from any
         corporate actions; and
      b) the Settlement Instructions that remained unsettled in the previous
         phase.

3. The settlement Instructions are processed through the following steps:
      a) check on the settlement status of the instruction;
      b) check on the counterparties’ securities and cash account capacities. This
          includes  verifying whether resources are  available as a  result  of
           collateralisation, as well as checking any exposure limits set by the
          Participant or its Agent Bank in the TARGET2 system;
       c)  if there is securities and cash capacity, T2S settles the securities by
          debiting the Seller and crediting the Purchaser with the amount of the
          transaction.
4.  If a number of settlement instructions are handled jointly in the same phase
    for reasons of optimisation, T2S makes the checks referred to in letter b) of
   the previous paragraph, based on the net balance following the relevant
   settlement Instructions.  If there  is not enough capacity to settle the net
   balance, T2S identifies the settlement Instructions that cannot be settled and
   then, taking into account their characteristics:
        -  checks the possibility of settling them through a collateralisation process,
         in the event of a cash deficit;
        -  checks the possibility of partially settling them, in the event of a
        securities deficit.
5. Settlement Instructions that have not been settled because of insufficient
   securities or cash are re-proposed in the subsequent phase of the same
   settlement day or for settlement on the subsequent day, until they are settled
   or cancelled in accordance with the Article 70.
6. Participants may change settlement Instructions that have been proposed
   again, also partially, but only with regard to the status indicators, on condition
   that such settlement Instructions have not been entered as non-changeable.

Article 75 – Sequence in Processing Settlement Instructions

1. To improve  the  efficiency  of  the  settlement  process, TS2 implements
   optimisation mechanisms aimed at maximising its outcome.
2.  If several settlement Instructions make use of the resources available on the
  same securities or cash account, the optimisation process takes into account
   the priority criteria for the management of settlement Instructions referred to
    in Article 68, paragraph 5. In the event of equal priority, the settlement
   Instructions with the  earlier settlement date are settled  first within the
   functioning limits of the T2S platform.

Article 76 – Management of non-settled Settlement Instructions
(Corporate Action of Flow - CAoF)

1. Monte Titoli may change or cancel the settlement Instructions that have not
   been  settled on  the  established  settlement date and concern  financial
   instruments involved in corporate actions or, in relation to such Instructions,
     it may  enter  additional  settlement  Instructions aimed  at  rectifying the
   distorting impacts of the event. The operating procedures for the management
   of these settlement Instructions are set out in the Instructions.
