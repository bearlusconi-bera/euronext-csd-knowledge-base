1.4.2 T2S schedule

18   The T2S schedule is under the control of the T2S operator, for creation of any new timelines, changing
19    and/or deletion of existing time for a period or event. The T2S Operator has the necessary privileges by
20    default to perform temporary or permanent changes to the T2S schedule. T2S ensures that the T2S sched-
21    ule always conforms to the T2S operating day calendar by currency for any changes.

22   T2S manages the transition between the various periods (see section Settlement day high level schedule
23    [ 158]) as an event. For each such event, T2S manages a planned time, a revised time and an effective
24    time:

25         l  The planned time corresponds to the standard schedule applied by default by T2S for every settlement
26       day. The T2S Operator can update this planned time in case of a permanent change in the regular
27        schedule;

28         l  The revised time is the foreseen time for the current settlement day, which usually coincides with the
29       planned time except when a delay has occurred. In contingency situations, the T2S Operator updates
30       the revised time while the planned time remains unchanged;

                                                                                                         Settlement Day

 1         l  The effective time is the time of the actual occurrence of the event during the current settlement day.

 2   T2S foresees the maintenance of individual T2S settlement currency dependent cut-offs and events. Howev-
 3     er, the T2S operator manages the overall processing of a settlement day based on a common T2S schedule
 4    configured for each T2S settlement currency. There is no schedule of a settlement day defined per currency
 5     in T2S, but distinct individual cut-offs and events per currency are defined.

 6    This multi-currency configuration allows for some flexibility within the boundaries of the real-time settlement
 7    closure (start of cut-off phase with DVP cut-off at 16:00 hrs CET and end of cut-off phase at 18:00 hrs CET
 8    with FOP cut-off).

 9   The T2S Operator is entitled to change some cut-offs and events (deadlines for receiving Settlement Instruc-
10    tions/Settlement Restrictions for same day settlement) of a settlement day. This can be done independently
11    for a T2S settlement currency, in exceptional circumstances or contingency situations, based on a request
12    from the relevant T2S dependent external system (eg. RTGS, CSD platform, CMS). This exceptional proce-
13    dure is to be defined in the T2S Manual of Operational Procedure (T2S MOP). These currency dependent
14    cut-offs and events are specific events within the T2S daily schedule that have a cash component and are
15    not a cut-off related to the T2S centralised processing such as the start of day and end of day. Such curren-
16    cy dependent cut-offs and events are:

17         l DVP cut-off (IDVP / EDVP) –remains harmonised for all currencies at 16h00;

18         l  Cash Settlement Restriction cut-off;

19         l  Settlement restrictions release

20         l  Reimbursement of intraday credit

21         l BATM (Bilaterally Agreed Treasury Management) cut-off;

22         l CBO (Central Bank Operation) cut-off;

23         l  Optional cash sweep;

24         l  Inbound liquidity transfer cut off;

25         l  Automated cash sweep.

26    This change in cut-offs and events are valid only for the current T2S settlement day. When a currency de-
27    pendent cut-off or event is extended for a currency, then the start of its dependent processes (e.g. cash
28   sweep) is automatically extended for the same currency.

29   T2S allows such a change under the following conditions:

30         l  The sequence and order of events (predecessors and/or successors events) in T2S must remain un-
31       changed, i.e. a currency dependent cut-off cannot be delayed beyond a successor scheduling event if
32         this would have an impact on T2S processing (e.g. a CBO cut-off for Danish Krone cannot be extended
33       beyond the EOD cut-off for T2S, which is the successor in the scheduling). This includes no additions or
34       removals of events, no changes in event ordering and no change in event dependencies;

35         l  In the exceptional cases that T2S experiences a general issue across all currencies, it could be necessary
36        that the T2S Operator would need to extend the EOD cut-off (e.g. the T2S revised times would apply).
37        In this case, T2S ensures the sequence of currency independent cut-offs (securities Settlement Re-

 2       be defined in the T2S MOP.

 3    In the exceptional cases that T2S experiences the arrival of late peak volume transactions on Friday evening
 4    that are not available for settlement at the regular NTS, the T2S Operator would need to process into addi-
 5    tional NTS cycles. The procedure to apply in case of such an event are defined in the T2S MOP.

 6   T2S controls the execution of the processes so that the start of a subsequent process depends on:

 7         l  The completion of the current process and/or;

 8         l  The occurrence of a cut-off.

 9   However, for the start of a process, which is under the dependency of a preceding process and cut-off, T2S
10    ensures that this process cannot start until the completion of the previous process and until the cut-off time
11     is reached.

EXCERPT (§1.4.4.1; PDF 163):
1.4.4.1 Start of day (SOD)

 5    This section presents the start of day processes.

 6   The SOD period starts after the successful completion of the previous EOD period and after 18:45, and is
 7    followed by the night-time settlement period.

 8   The SOD period concentrates on the change of T2S business date, the taking of the common Snapshot and
 9    preparation of the night-time settlement period. It includes the processing of the feeds from collateral man-
10   agement systems (CMS) and payment/settlement banks for the reference prices and eligible assets (for val-
11    uation purposes).
